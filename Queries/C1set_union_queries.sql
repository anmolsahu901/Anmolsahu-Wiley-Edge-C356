-- UNION and UNION ALL – combine two or more result sets of multiple queries into a single result set.
-- INTERSECT           –  show you a couple of ways to simulate the INTERSECT operator.
-- MINUS               – explain to you the SQL MINUS operator and show you how to simulate it.

    column_list...-- To combine result set of two or more queries using the UNION operator, these are the basic rules that you must follow:
    -- First, the number and the orders of columns that appear in all SELECT statements must be the same.
    -- Second, the data types of columns must be the same or compatible.
    -- By default, the UNION operator removes duplicate rows even if you don’t specify the DISTINCT operator explicitly.
    -- Create 2 tables;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t2;

CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY);

-- combine result sets returned from t1 and t2 tables with UNION
